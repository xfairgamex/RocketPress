# RocketPress Product Requirements Document (PRD)

**Product Name:** AutoDTF
**Purpose:** To fully automate the order, print, press, and ship workflow for direct-to-film (DTF) print shops, particularly those using Shopify. AutoDTF integrates with Shopify and suppliers like S\&S Activewear to create an efficient, minimal-touch system that reduces human error and boosts throughput.

---

## 1. Overview

AutoDTF is a SaaS platform that automates the DTF production process from Shopify order to shipment. It pulls in Shopify orders, matches SKUs with artwork and garment blanks, auto-generates gang sheets, interfaces with DTF printers and cutters, manages blank garment inventory, places just-in-time orders through the S\&S Activewear API, guides the press process with visual mockups, and completes shipping label generation through barcode-driven workflows. This minimizes downtime, ensures the right garments are always on hand, and significantly reduces human error in production.

* **Database:** PostgreSQL&#x20;
* **Queue System:** Redis or Laravel Horizon
* **Printing API:** Integration layer for RIP software + thermal label printers

## 5. MVP Development Milestones

1. **Shopify integration & SKU/artwork mapping**
2. **AI gang sheet builder w/ preview**
3. **Print queue & RIP export**
4. **Barcode generation & order tracking system**
5. **Thermal label printer support**
6. **S\&S Activewear inventory + ordering integration**
